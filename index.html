                            <div class="description">This is a game that I created using JavaScript, PIXI.js, html and
                                css.
                                The goal of the game is to collide with the aliens in the music notes to gain points.
                                The red whole
                                notes are "enemy aliens" that cause the main character, Meep, to lose life. To gain life
                                back, Meep needs
                                to collect the base clef note. Once the user loses all life, the game is over and the
                                user has the option to
                                play agian. There were a few challenges that I ran into with this project. The main one
                                being that
                                I orinially wanted Meep to hit the enemies with the trombone in order to gain points. I
                                had a lot of trouble
                                making this become a reality, so I changed it so that when Meep collides with the
                                specific enemy, the score
                                is increased. I learned a lot while making this game, such as how to use sprites, make a
                                moving background and
                                insert audio into the application. I created the sprites for Meep, enemy aliens, and the
                                notes using adobe illustrator. I also
                                recorded myself playing my own trombone and edited the sounds using audacity to give it
                                a "space-y" tone.

                                    Picker</a> is a website
                                designed to let the user search pokemon based on either name or pokemon type. Once the
                                user completes the search,
                                they have the option to add that pokemon to their pokeball. The local storage will use
                                this information to keep the
                                data saved when a different page is used. Using this website will help the user create
                                their own pokemon party. I ran into a few challenges
                                with this project. The data that was read from the pokemon API was challenging to figure
                                out the correct links. I went through
                                the API many times to determine how to get certain data for the website. One thing that
                                I plan to improve for this project
                                is to add previous and next buttons so that the entire page is not filled with all the
                                pokemon.

                            <div class="description">The assignment for this project was to design an app using Adobe
                                Illustrator and
                                create a poster that advertises it. Around the time of Halloween, I came up with an idea
                                that I thought
                                would be perfect for trick-or-treaters in 2020. This app was designed for families and
                                young people who
                                would be trick-or-treating. Due to the pandemic, many people did not go out on Halloween
                                and this app
                                could help lessen the anxiety about the disease. It would allow the user to see what
                                houses were available to
                                trick-or-treat and when they were available (if specified) as well as special Covid-19
                                instructions for the
                                tick-or-treaters. This app will also allow users to find safe public areas such as a
                                park bench, or a stop sign
                                where users could safely trade their candy. One great feature about this app is that the
                                user can see their candy
                                inventory and update it accordingly so that they know what they have and whether they
                                would want to trade any of it
                                for something better. This was one of the most rewarding projects I have completed. Not
                                only did it allow me to
                                come up with an original idea, but I was also able to utilize Illustrator for the first
                                time and create a successful
                                app design. Check out this project <a href="./track-or-treat.html">here</a>
